    <div class="card-white"> <h2>👜 My Hobbies and passions ⛷️</h2>
	<p>I love to travel and it's a passion, I had the chance to visit extraordinary places such as Mongolia, Burma, Australia or India for example which allowed me to learn a lot about other cultures and evolve personally thanks to all this learning. I also practice skiing which is a hobby that is dear to me. I have been skiing since I was 4 years old and I have always loved this sport because of the speed and concentration it requires, which is a way for me to let off steam. I also love the cinema and the theater which I have been practicing for more than 10 years.</p></div>
